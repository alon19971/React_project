      <h2>About Me & Project</h2>
      <p>My name is Alon, I'm a 26 years old from Israel,
        a second-year student in Practical Engineer University.
        My journey into the world of web development is fueled by
        my passion for exploring cultures and countries. Having
        traveled around the globe, I've developed a deep love for
        diverse cultures and the unique stories they tell. This project,
        WorldExplorer, is a manifestation of my desire to share that
        passion with others and create a platform where we can all
        discover and appreciate the beauty of our world together.</p>
